# SANPolyA: a deep learning method for identifying Poly(A) signals

Polyadenylation plays a regulatory role in transcription. The recognition of polyadenylation signal (PAS) motif sequence is an important step in polyadenylation. In the past few years, some statistical machine learning-based and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for PAS identification. Although these methods predict PAS with success, there is room for their improvement on PAS identification.

We published our model script file and the trainned model files on several PAS datasets.
